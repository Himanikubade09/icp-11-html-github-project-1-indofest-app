    <h3>About Bhai-Dooj:</h3>
    
    <p>
        Bhai Dooj is a Hindu festival that celebrates the loving relationship between brothers and sisters. It is celebrated on the fifth day of Diwali (the new moon day or Bhai Dooj day), which usually falls two days after Diwali. It is a day for brothers to visit their sisters and for sisters to bless their brothers with long life, prosperity, and happiness.
        Bhai Dooj is a beautiful celebration of the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. It's a day of sharing love, protecting each other, and thanking each other for all the support throughout life. Whether you celebrate it in a traditional manner or with modern touches, the festival brings families closer and strengthens relationships.
