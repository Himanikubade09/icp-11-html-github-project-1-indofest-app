            The Konkan region, nestled along the western coast of India, is a land teeming with devotees deeply rooted in religious traditions and an array of vibrant festivals. Among these celebrations, the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi stands out as a beacon of devotion, eagerly anticipated by Ganesha devotees throughout the region. This year, Ganesh Chaturthi falls on September 19, a date etched in the hearts of the people of Konkan.</p>
            
            
            <p>
            One of the most captivating aspects of this festival is the intricate craftsmanship of Lord Ganesha idols. In the bustling villages of Konkan, particularly in Akeri village, Kudal taluka of Sindhudurg district, a legion of skilled artists tirelessly work to create these beautiful representations of Lord Ganesha. Their work is a testament to the fusion of art and spirituality.The process of crafting these divine idols commences as early as June, as artists dedicate themselves to this sacred task. Akeri village alone boasts more than 50 artisans who labor diligently to produce over 1500 small and large Ganpati idols. These exquisite creations are a symbol of the artistic heritage that thrives in Konkan.
    
            What makes Akeri village even more remarkable is its contribution to neighboring states, particularly Goa. The Ganpati idols from this village find their way into the hearts and homes of devotees in Goa. These idols range in price from a modest 1500 rupees to more intricate and larger ones valued at 15 thousand rupees. This exchange not only enriches the cultural ties between these regions but also provides a seasonal livelihood to the dedicated artists.
