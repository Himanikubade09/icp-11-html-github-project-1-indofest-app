 <h1>Dussehra</h1>
 <img src="../../img/dashera2.jpeg" height="250px" alt="dashera"/>
 <p>
 Dussehra, in Hinduism, holiday marking the triumph of Rama, an avatar of
Vishnu, over the 10-headed demon king Ravana, who abducted Rama‚Äôs wife, Sita. In
the epic Ramayana, Rama, with the assistance of the monkey-general Hanuman,
attacks Lanka to rescue Sita and slays Ravana. The festival‚Äôs name is derived
from the Sanskrit words dasha (‚Äúten‚Äù) and hara (‚Äúdefeat‚Äù).
 Culmination of Navratri and Durga Puja celebrations
 Symbolizing the victory of good over evil, Dussehra is celebrated on the
10th day of the month of Ashvina (September‚ÄìOctober), the seventh month of the
Hindu calendar, with the appearance of the full moon, an event called the
‚Äúbright fortnight‚Äù (shukla paksha). Dussehra coincides with the culmination of
the nine-day Navratri festival and with the tenth day of the Durga Puja
festival. Both Navratri and Durga Puja involve prayers offered to goddess Durga,
a principal form of the supreme goddess in Hinduism. A collective of nine
avatars of the deity, called Navadurga, is worshipped during Navratri. Durga
Puja honors the goddess‚Äôs demon-slaying form, known as Mahishasuramardini. The
coinciding days of Dussehra and Vijaya Dashami mark the victory of Rama over
Ravana for some, and of Durga over Mahishasura for others. For many, it marks
the beginning of preparation for Diwali, which occurs 20 days after Dussehra.

 <p>
 Ramlila Maidan is one of the famous places to visit in Delhi during
Dussehra. This place has been famous for various events. One of the reasons for
which Ramlila Maidan is famous is the Dashami evening when the Ravana Dahan
takes place. The giant-sized effigies are burnt and then people celebrate the
victory of Ram. The performers, who take part in the plays, greet the audience
dressed as Lord Ram and his kin.

 <h3>Dashers important</h3>
 <p>
 According to Ramayana, it was on Dasara that Lord Ram killed the tenheaded Ravana. Ravana was a great warrior and it was after a fierce battle that
he was killed in the hands of Ram. Ravana has ten heads, which brings us the
word ‚ÄúDasha -hara‚Äù means ‚Äúa person with ten heads killed!‚Äù
 Dasara is also related with Mahabharata. Pandavas were sent to the forest
for twelve years being lost in the gambling in the hands of Kauravas. In the
thirteenth year, they had to spend time in exile without identifying themselves
as Pandavas. To accomplish this, all five of them tie up their weapons and leave
them at a Jammi tree. They pray to the tree to safeguard those weapons till they
come back. And then they join the court of Virata as helpers.
 However, Kauravas sense that they are in Virata. They planned to spoil
their exile and thus wanted to grab their kingdom forever. For this, they draw a
plan and invite Pandavas to war. With nothing else to do, Arjuna, the third of
Pandavas, goes back to the Jammi tree where they hid their weapons. He thanks
the tree for protecting their weapons and takes them from the tree. With the
tree‚Äôs blessings and the auspiciousness of the Muhurtha, he easily defeats lakhs
of soldiers of the Kaurava army alone.
 That day was nothing but Dasami or Dasara- the same day when Lord Ram killed
Ravan. Arjuna has another name ‚Äì Vijaya. Meaning ‚Äì Successful. This is the
reason why we call Dasara Vijaya Dasami
