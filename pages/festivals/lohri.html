            <h4>About Lohri:</h4>
            <p>
                Lohri is a popular festival celebrated primarily in the northern regions of India, especially in Punjab,
                Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu. It marks the end of winter and the beginning of the harvest
                season, particularly for crops like sugarcane, sesame, and mustard.
                <b>It is celebrated on the 13th of January every year, marking the end of the winter solstice.</b>A
                central
                feature of the festival is the lighting of a bonfire, around which people gather to sing traditional
                songs, dance (especially Bhangra and Gidda), and throw offerings like sesame seeds, sugarcane, and
                jaggery into the fire as a symbol of gratitude for the harvest.People enjoy foods like til (sesame
                seeds), jaggery, rewri, and popcorn, which are believed to bring good health and prosperity.Lohri is not
                only about the harvest but also celebrates the communityâ€™s togetherness, the warmth of the bonfire, and
                the joy of new beginnings.
