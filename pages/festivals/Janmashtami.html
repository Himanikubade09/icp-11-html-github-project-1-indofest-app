 <p>
 Krishna Janmashtami, also known simply as Janmashtami or Gokulashtami,
is an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth
avatar of Vishnu. It is an important festival particularly to the Vaishnavism
tradition of Hinduism. It is observed according to Hindu luni-solar calendar, on
the eighth day (Ashtami) of the Krishna Paksha.

 <h3>Janmashtimi important</h3>
 <p>
 Information about Krishna's life is noted in the Mahabharata, the
Puranas, and Bhagavata Purana. Krishna is the eighth son of Devaki (mother) and
Vasudeva (father).[5] Surrounding the time of his birth, persecution was
rampant, freedoms were being denied, and King Kamsa's life was threatened.[14]
Krishna was born within a prison in Mathura, India where his parents were
constrained by his uncle, Kamsa.[5] During Devaki's wedding, Kamsa was warned by
a celestial voice that Devaki's eighth son would be the cause of his death.[5]
In an effort to defy this prophesy, Kamsa imprisoned his sister Devaki and her
husband and promptly killed the first six of her newborns after their birth.[5]
The guards responsible for keeping watch over Devaki's cell fell asleep and the
cell doors were miraculously opened at the time of Krishna's birth.[5] These
events allowed Vasudeva to send Krishna across the Yamuna River to his foster
parents, Yashoda (mother) and Nanda (father).[5] This legend is celebrated on
Janmashtami by people keeping fasts, singing devotional songs of love for
Krishna, and keeping a vigil into the night.[15]
 Throughout Krishna's childhood and young adult life, Balarama, Krishna's
half-brother, was a "constant companion" for him. Balarama joined Krishna in the
major events that are celebrated in Vraja, Brindavan, Dravarka, and Mathura such
as stealing butter, chasing calves, playing in the cow pens, and participating
in wrestling matches.[16]
