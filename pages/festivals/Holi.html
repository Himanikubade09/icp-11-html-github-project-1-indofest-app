 <p>Holi is an ancient Hindu festival that originated in India and Nepal
and is now celebrated in many places around the world. The date changes each
year depending on the full moon, but it is held some time between the end of
February and the middle of March, and lasts a night and a day.</p>

 <p>
 These are the places to enjoy the traditional version of Holi.
Locals perform rituals at temples and at home. Later, they plunge each other
with colored water or powder. Mathura is the place where Lord Krishna was born.
The holy towns of Mathura and Vrindavan will be drenched with colors. The best
of all celebrations is found in Banke Bihari temple, where the celebrations
start the day before Holi. During the eve of Holi, people throw flowers at each
other. A procession starts early in the morning before Holi from Banke Bihari
Temple and leads to Mathura. On Holiday, the festival of colors takes place in
Dwarkadheesh Temple of Mathura. Bhang, a marijuana-spiked drink is served at
Vishram Ghat.

 <p>Holi is a Hindu festival that has been celebrated since ancient
times. The Holi Festival is celebrated as a way to welcome in spring, and also
is seen as a new beginning where people can release all their inhibitions and
start fresh. It is said that during the Holi Festival, the gods turn a blind
eye, and itâ€™s one of the few times extremely devout Hindus allow themselves to
let loose. They open up and enjoy each otherâ€™s company, take time to dance and
party, and throw their cultural norms to the side. On the first day of the
festival, a bonfire is lit to symbolically burn away all the bad and give way to
a colorful and vibrant new future.
 At the Holi Festival, participants throw powder dye into the air, covering
all in attendance with vibrant colors. In a religious sense, the colors are rich
with symbolism and have multiple meanings: they can mean a vibrant new life and
even represent sin in a way. For some, washing off the dye at the end of the day
can mean new commitment to live well, as cleansing oneself of evils and
demons.</p>
