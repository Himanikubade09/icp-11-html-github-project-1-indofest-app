            Raksha Bandhan strengthens family relationships, especially between brothers and sisters.
            Sisters tie a rakhi on their brotherâ€™s wrist, apply a tilak, and pray for his well-being.
            Brothers give gifts to their sisters and promise to protect them throughout life.
            The festival also promotes love, harmony, and unity beyond just siblingsâ€”it is now common for friends,
            cousins, and even neighbors to celebrate.

            Navaratri[a] is an annual Hindu festival observed in honor of the goddess Durga, an aspect of Adi
            Parashakti, the supreme goddess. It spans over nine nights, first in the month of Chaitra (March/April of
            the Gregorian calendar), and again in the month of Ashvin (Septemberâ€“October).[2][3] It is observed for
            different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Hindu Indian cultural sphere.[2][4]
            Theoretically, there are four seasonal Navaratris. However, in practice, it is the post-monsoon autumn
            festival called Sharada Navaratri. There are 2 Gupta Navaratris or "Secret Navaratris" as well, one starting
            on the Shukla Paksha Pratipada of the Magha Month (Magha Gupta Navaratri) and another starting in the Shukla
            Paksha Pratipada of Ashadha Month.
