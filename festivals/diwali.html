    <h4>About Diwali:</h4>
    <p>
        Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and KƒÅrtika‚Äîbetween around mid-September and mid-November. The celebrations generally last five or six days. Rangoli decorations, made using coloured fine powder or sand, are popular during Diwali. The festivities begin two days before amƒÅvasyƒÅ, on Dhanteras, and extend two days after, until the second (or 17th) day of the month of Kartik. (According to Indologist Constance Jones, this night ends the lunar month of Ashwin and starts the month of Kartik ‚Äì but see this note and Amanta and Purnima systems.) The darkest night is the apex of the celebration.

        The festival climax is on the third day and is called the main Diwali. It is an official holiday in a dozen countries, while the other festive days are regionally observed as either public or optional restricted holidays in India. In Nepal, it is also a multiday festival, although the days and rituals are named differently, with the climax being called the Tihar festival by Hindus and Swanti festival by Buddhists.

            Dev Deepawali, also known as Dev Diwali or the Diwali of the Gods, is a significant Hindu festival observed in Varanasi, India. It occurs on the full moon night of the Hindu month of Kartika, which falls between November and December, precisely 15 days after the main Diwali celebration.Varanasi hosts the big festival of Dev Diwali, also known as Dev Deepawali, which is particularly known for its magnificent Ganga Aarti and the amazing display of millions of diyas near the ghats

        <p>
            The essence of this festival lies in commemorating the victory of Lord Shiva over the formidable demon Tripurasura. According to ancient mythology, Tripurasura was a powerful three-headed demon who had conquered all three realms and instilled fear among the people. In response to this menace, Lord Shiva valiantly took up the challenge and eventually vanquished the demon, restoring peace and harmony.

To rejoice in this triumph, it is believed that Lord Shiva descended to the earthly realm and immersed himself in the holy waters of the Ganges River. The devout residents of Varanasi expressed their joy and devotion by illuminating the ghats, the steps leading to the river, with countless diyas (earthen lamps) to welcome the divine presence of the gods. This marked the origin of the revered tradition of Dev Deepawali.
