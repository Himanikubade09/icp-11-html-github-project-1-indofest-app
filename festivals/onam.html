    <h4>Onam:</h4>
    <p>Onam commemorates the return of the generous daitya king Mahabali after he was banished to the netherworld by Vamana (the fifth avatar of Hindu deity Vishnu)According to the Hindu legends, after Indra (the king of the devas) is defeated by Mahabali (the king of the asuras), the devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who agrees to restore Indra to power. To do so, Vishnu incarnates as a dwarf priest called Vamana. The king Mahabali (himself a devotee of Vishnu) conducts ritual prayers, one of which is attended by Vamana, who requests only three feet (steps) of land to build a fire-altar. Mahabali agrees, despite being told about Vamana's divine nature by the sage Shukra. Vamana grows in size, and in three strides, encompasses all of the universe and beyond. The three worlds are restored to Indra, and Mahabali and the asuras are banished to the netherworld (Patala). However, witnessing Mahabali's love for his subjects, Vamana grants the king's sole wish to visit his kingdom once every year. This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year.</p>
    <p>
        The earliest known reference to the word Onam as a celebration is found in MaturaikkƒÅ√±ci ‚Äì a Sangam era Tamil poem from the 3rd century CE. It mentions a festival called Onam being celebrated in dedication to Mayon (Vishnu) in Madurai, when games and duels were held in temple premises, oblations were sent to the temples, people wore new clothes and feasted.
The 8th-century Alvar mystic saint Nammalvar mentions of the one who measured the three worlds, a parallel to the legend of Mahabali and Vamana.
The 9th-century Pathikas and Pallads by Periyalvar describes Onam celebrations and offerings to Vishnu, mentions feasts and community events.
An 11th-century inscription in the Thrikkakara Temple (Kochi) dedicated to Vamana ‚Äì an avatar of Vishnu ‚Äì mentions a series of offerings made by a votary over two days prior and on Thiru Onam.
