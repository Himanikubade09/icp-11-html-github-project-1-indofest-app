            <h4>About Raksha bandhan:</h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Raksha Bandhan, also known as Rakhi, is a Hindu festival that celebrates the bond of love and protection between brothers and sisters. It is observed on the full moon day (Purnima) of the Shravana month (Julyâ€“August).
                    <br>
                    Raksha Bandhan strengthens family relationships, especially between brothers and sisters.
                    Sisters tie a rakhi on their brotherâ€™s wrist, apply a tilak, and pray for his well-being.
                    Brothers give gifts to their sisters and promise to protect them throughout life.
                    The festival also promotes love, harmony, and unity beyond just siblingsâ€”it is now common for friends, cousins, and even neighbors to celebrate.

                    The central theme of Raksha Bandhan is the promise of protection. The sister ties a sacred thread (Rakhi) on her brotherâ€™s wrist, praying for his well-being, and in return, the brother vows to protect her.
                    <br>
                    It strengthens the relationship between siblings, fostering love, care, and mutual respect. Even distant or estranged siblings reconnect on this occasion.
                    <br>
                    The festival is not limited to biological siblings. Rakhis are also tied to cousins, friends, and even soldiers as a mark of respect and protection.
                    Raksha Bandhan is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology. Stories of Lord Krishna and Draupadi, as well as Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun, highlight the festivalâ€™s importance.
