            <h4>About Mahashivratri:</h4>
            <p>
                Mahashivratri is a major Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Shiva, observed annually on the 14th night of
                the lunar month of Phalguna (February-March). It is considered one of the most sacred nights in
                Hinduism, symbolizing the divine union of Shiva and Shakti.
                Mahashivratri marks the night when Lord Shiva performed the Tandava, the cosmic dance of creation and
                destruction. <b>On this night, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati were married.</b>
                The festival is observed for spiritual growth, self-discipline, and seeking Lord Shiva‚Äôs blessings for
                peace and prosperity.
                Devotees observe fasting and stay awake all night in devotion.
                Temples are decorated, and special pujas, bhajans, and kirtans are performed.
                Worshippers offer milk, honey, water, and Bilva leaves to the Shivling.
                Many chant ‚ÄúOm Namah Shivaya‚Äù, meditate, and seek inner transformation.
