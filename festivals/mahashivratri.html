            <h4>About Mahashivratri:</h4>
            <p>
                Mahashivratri is a major Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Shiva, observed annually on the 14th night of
                the lunar month of Phalguna (February-March). It is considered one of the most sacred nights in
                Hinduism, symbolizing the divine union of Shiva and Shakti.
                Mahashivratri marks the night when Lord Shiva performed the Tandava, the cosmic dance of creation and
                destruction. <b>On this night, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati were married.</b>
                The festival is observed for spiritual growth, self-discipline, and seeking Lord Shiva’s blessings for
                peace and prosperity.
                Devotees observe fasting and stay awake all night in devotion.
                Temples are decorated, and special pujas, bhajans, and kirtans are performed.
                Worshippers offer milk, honey, water, and Bilva leaves to the Shivling.
                Many chant “Om Namah Shivaya”, meditate, and seek inner transformation.

                <li>
                    <h4><u>Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh ☘️</u></h4>
                </li>
                <p>The Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga Temple is the focal point of Mahashivratri celebrations.
                    The Bhasma Aarti, a unique ritual where the Shivling is covered with sacred ash, takes place early
                    in
                    the morning.
                    The temple remains open all night, with continuous chanting of "Om Namah Shivaya" and Rudra Abhishek
                    ceremonies.
                    Grand Shobha Yatras (processions) are organized, with thousands of devotees carrying Shiva idols
                    through
                    the city.</p>

                    <h4><u>Kedarnath, Uttarakhand 🏔️</u></h4>
                </li>
                <p>Since the Kedarnath Temple remains closed during winter, Mahashivratri is celebrated at Ukhimath
                    Temple,
                    where the deity's idol is worshipped during the winter months.
                    Devotees perform Rudrabhishek and stay awake all night, singing bhajans and meditating on Lord
                    Shiva.
                    Pilgrims visit nearby temples like Guptkashi and Triyuginarayan Temple, which have special
                    Mahashivratri
                    rituals.
                    Even in extreme cold, devotees light lamps, offer prayers, and seek blessings for spiritual growth.
